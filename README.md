# Signature Recognition and Classification using CNN

This project involves building a complete pipeline to process scanned handwritten signatures, extract and organize them, and classify them using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It also includes performance comparison with traditional feature engineering techniques such as HOG and SIFT.

## üìå Problem Statement

Given a set of images containing handwritten signatures arranged in tabular form, the goal is to:
- Detect and extract individual signatures.
- Segment and organize them into folders based on individual IDs.
- Perform train-test split for classification.
- Train a CNN model to classify signatures to their corresponding individuals.
- Compare CNN-based feature extraction with manual techniques like HOG and SIFT.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Ensured consistent dataset structure for training and validation.

### 3. **Model Training**
- Implemented CNN model using PyTorch with configurable image size, batch size, and epochs.
- Compared performance with a baseline ANN model.
- Plotted training and validation accuracy/loss graphs.

### 4. **Evaluation**
- Evaluated using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-Score**
- CNN significantly outperformed ANN in both accuracy and loss reduction over epochs.
